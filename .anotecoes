Execute the following query in MYSQL Workbench

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';

Where root as your user localhost as your URL and password as your password

Then run this query to refresh privileges:

Try connecting using node after you do so.

If that doesn't work, try it without @'localhost' part.
